  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - asset/images/fakoro.jpg
    - asset/images/img1.jpg
    - asset/images/img2.jpg
    - asset/images/img3.jpg
    - asset/images/img4.jpg

    - asset/images/jean1.jpg
    - asset/images/jean2.jpg
    - asset/images/jean3.jpg
    - asset/images/jean4.jpg

    - asset/images/fem1.jpg
    - asset/images/fem2.jpg
    - asset/images/fem3.jpg
    - asset/images/fem4.jpg

    - asset/images/en1.jpg
    - asset/images/en2.jpg
    - asset/images/en3.jpg
    - asset/images/en4.jpg

    - asset/svg/register.svg

    # - assets/images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
